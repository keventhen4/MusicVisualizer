Circle.py and TerrainWavesMic.py are currently usable as music visualizers. However, Circle's differentiation between bass and higher tone sounds is too great and TerrainWavesMic can only be used on a mic meaning it would require virtual outputs to function as a real music visualizer.

Depending on the version of python and modules, some code may need to be adjusted
    Ex:
> "noise2d" to "noise2"
